**Description:**
*The above article speaks about the split of expectations and interests of people who fall under the umbrella of "front-end" development. I also put this in quotes because it's such a broad term nowadays, people have different ideas on what it may entail at times. Professionally, I view front-end development as linking backend data with client UI based on designs curated by a design team. However, others and I initially view front-end development as the creation of pages design-wise on top of their implementation granted the backend requirements are in place for us.*

*The article speaks about different opinions on how to address this divide of definition. It has some questionable takes and comments but I believe it to be used to clarify the points on how broad the term front-end developer can be used. Essentially, the rapid evolution of the web industry has made it so the meanings of words "front-end developer" or "fullstack developer" doesn't match what's being asked.*

*Jennifer Zheng(lz2278) Commented: I deeply relate with what thsi article discusses about identity crisis for front-end developer. A lot of time in the working setting, the job descriptions or the work given are not clearly stated and distributed to the right people accordingly. Therefore, it ends up with that people specialized in one part have to be forced to do other tasks that are unrelated or having little relevance to their skillset. Thus, having a clear understanding as well as divide for front-end developer's jobs is a essential problem waited to get resolved.* 

*Mark Lung(ml6754) Commented: an excellent read! This is good to know as I am currently looking for a job, and is excellent knowledge to help manage my expectations when apply to jobs like "front-end developer" and "Full-Stack developer"*
